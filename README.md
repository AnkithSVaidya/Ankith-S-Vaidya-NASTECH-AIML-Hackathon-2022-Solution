This is a Heart Disease prediction model.
First I have setup matplotlib and read the data.
Then I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis.
Following which I have obtained a co-relation matrix.
Then I have performed Data Processing and obtained Training models with the help of sklearn.
I have also performed Logistic Regression.
Next is to Validate SVM model,k-nearest neighbour,decision tree.
Then I get to know that Accuracy score in decision tree is highest.
I will construct a pipeline to fine tune it.
At last I have print out the predicted result.



I have also done this in an alternative way(My second ipynb link) where I have used only simple concepts that I had learnt during my training course
